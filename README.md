# Deep Learning Algorithms For Time Series

For Mathematical Engineering graduation project, feed-forward neural networks and recurrent neural networks, which are a subject of deep learning was thoroughly examined. In the project, especially the mathematical relationships and the related equations were presented. Also, a special type of recurrent neural network for time series, LSTM was explored in depth.

The project was done by:
